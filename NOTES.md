# Part 2 - WordPress Theme Development - How to create a Custom Admin Page
- We activated our theme here
- Now, the instructor is following a rule of creating new functions in the `inc` folder by doing `function-name.php`
- When choosing the position for your menu, select a higher number than the separator. You can choose over 110. This is something I need to read about. Menu position in WordPress.
- Learned about `add_menu_page`
- Learned about `add_action`
- Learned about `get_template_directory_uri()`
- WordPress lets us use their premade icons at https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/#editor-alignright
- We can use them too.
- We added an admin menu. And it looks really cool.
