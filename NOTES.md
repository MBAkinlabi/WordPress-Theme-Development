# Part 1 - WordPress Theme Development - Custom Font Icon and Folder Structure 
- I downloaded WordPress (Initial commit)
- I downloaded MAMP (Initial commit)
- Already commited in the last...
- Now moving on to making some changes. 
- I searched for "what is the best mysql database collation for wordpress" and found that `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` is the best through this StackOverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/367711/what-is-the-best-collation-to-use-for-mysql-with-php and https://www.bramvandenbulcke.be/en/kb/recommended-database-charset-and-collation-wordpress
- I set up my database name `my-first
- `Charset: utf8mb4` and `Collation: utf8mb4_unicode_ci`
- Rename `wp-config-sample.php` to `wp-config.php`
- Wow, my WordPress is now up and running.
- In the `wp-config.php` file. Change `WP_DEBUG` to `true`. It's `false by default. It lets us see php erros, warnings and all other. Change it back to `false` when you're done.
- I learned about `icomoon.io`.
- I imported all the `.svg` files that I downloaded for the project and uploaded it on the website through the app.
- Wow, I converted all my icons into vector fonts. I imported them and I was able to do all that. Now, I can use them on the fly. 
- What happened was that the SVG are cached and I use it from them. As long as I don't delete cache, my icons are there.
- Before clicking download, click on the small setting icon beside the `Download` button and remove the name of the `iconmoon`. Change it to sunset-icon
- Change the class prefix to `sunset`
- Note that Instructor is just doing this to enable a customized feel for the theme he wants to build. Nothing really special is happening here.
- Go to the `CSS Selector` and check `Use a class`
- Change the class to `.sunset-icon`
- If you've created a really cool font, you can customize the metadata. 
- Close the tab and download the fonts.
- Go to `wp-content/themes`
- Created the `my-first` folder there.
- Creating the folder structure I want in this theme. 
- `inc` folder is to put different files that handle different functions.
- We created the fonts folder in the CSS and pasted all the vector fonts we generated before. Wow. 
- You have to add your screenshot too. It's a preview. It has to be 1200 x 900.
- If you're creating yours, it has to be 1200 x 900 and named `screenshot.png` 
- We did what others we had to do and then go to the WordPress dashboard, Appearance and Themes, and can see that the Theme is there. Wow.
