- You can reorder the the submenu link by manually putting one above the other. You can see how we did it at the `add_submenu_page` there.
- Always check to ensure that you've not already used a particular function name so that it doesn't generate bugs
- WordPress doesn't give you the option to create custom post format. That means you have to stick to what you have in that list.
- Without knowing that I was making a mistake, I've been writing `<input />` with the self closing tag which is wrong.
- Wrapping the input with `label` makes the whole thing clickable. including what's outside of it. I didn't know that before.
- Wow, as I was doing this, I realized that the `var_dump` wasn't working so I found this solution here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28904648/wordpress-var-dump-in-functions-php?rq=1
- And now, my `var_dump` is now really showing. I'm happy. 
- According to the page here, something was probably rendering on top of the `var_dump`
- Note that the `@` automatically does isset for us. So the thing only goes on if it's really set. If it's not set, then it's ignored. I later learned that it suppresses errors in PHP. Read more here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1032161/what-is-the-use-of-the-symbol-in-php
- Interesting. I can now see the different post formats and how it works. We don't have to give users the options to choose the post format they want. We include them by default and give them different styling. I read about post formats on the WordPress documentation and it's interesting to see everything.
- I should probably always wait until the end of the video before making my judgement. The instructor is doing a pretty good job. Wow.
- Note that the standard post format is always there in the WordPress by default. Not up for negotiation.
