# Part 4 - WordPress Theme Development - Create Custom Options with Settings API
- It's recommended that you use the Settings API to take care of custom options and all other things. It gives you the security that you need. You know things like checkboxes or forms and all those other data that you could later store in the database.
- Note that the `add_action` is inside the `myfirst_add_admin_page` so that it doesn't work if the function isn't triggered.
- `register_setting` creates a section in the `wp_options` of the database. Record a custom group fields or settings. 
- The third option in `register_setting` should be used if you're creating something that's particular and want to sanitize it. But in most cases, WordPress automatically takes care of that for us. 
- Inside the `register_setting` you'll notice the group name is separated by `-` and the single option is separated by `_`. It's best practice to do that.
- `add_settings_section` adds the section where we want to put the form
- `do_settings_sections` to specify where the sections belong. 
- To understand. Different forms belong in different sections. It's like having different forms and different sections on your page.
- Perfect example is to go check the Permalink Settings and you'll see `Common Settings` and `Optional` Two different sections of forms on the same page.
- `add_settings_field` to add custom fields. 
- `submit_button` to submit the form. It has some args for customization. Leaving it empty gives you the default `Save Changes` text from WordPress.
- `get_option` for getting the option we've registered. Like getting something from the database. 
- `esc_attr` - Because it's somehow dangerous to use `get_option` in a field you want to continue to display. A malicious user could easily use that to make a database query. So use `esc_attr`
- On the form, WordPress uses `action="options.php"` to load all the form anything. All the forms are pointed to `options.php`. It manages everything.
- `settings_errors` should always be at the top of the form. It's the error message WordPress gives us when something is wrong.
